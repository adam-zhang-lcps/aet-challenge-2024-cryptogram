#+title: Solution for 2024 AET Challenge Day Cryptogram/Cryptography Challenge

This repository contains the [[https://uiua.org][Uiua]] script my team and I used to solve AET Challenge Day's cryptogram/cryptography challenge.

All code is in [[file:main.ua][main.ua]] with comments and notes on the solutions.

Test and run this code [[https://uiua.org/pad][on the online interactive editor]]! Unfortunately, the code is too long to embed in the URL, so you'll have to copy-paste the content from [[file:main.ua][main.ua]] into the editor.

If you have an LCPS Google account, you can experience the challenge yourself (if it's still online) [[https://sites.google.com/lcps.org/aetchallengedaycipher1][here]].
